# TensorFlow Snippets

![feature X](images/icon.png)

This extension includes a set of useful code snippets for developing TensorFlow models.

## Features

The extension includes two sets of snippets. The first are used to generate a framework for training neural networks:

- tf:trainer: Generates an entire training framework based on learn API.
- tf:cnn-classifier: Generates a convolutional neural network classifier.
- tf:mnist: Generates data loader for mnist dataset.

The second set of commands are short code snippets for common TensorFlow operations:
- tf:import: Imports TensorFlow package.
- tf:conv2d: Defines a 2D convolution layer.
- tf:dense: Defines a dense (fully connected) layer.
- tf:maxpool2d: Defines a max pooling layer.
- tf:dropout: Defines a dropout layer.
- tf:cross-entropy: Defines a softmax cross entropy loss.

## Requirements

This package relies on TensorFlow and NumPy packages:
```
pip install numpy tensorflow
```


## Release Notes
